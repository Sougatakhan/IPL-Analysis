# IPL-Analysis
This study is novel in that it used both pre-match variables (home-ground advantage) and real-time measures (e.g., how many runs were scored in the powerplay) in a statistical context to classify match results. The results can be used to adapt in-game tactics to maximize advantages of batsmen in favorable contexts. Every team has dream of winning the final cup or trophy. The dream becomes their goal and that goal is achieved by planned action for unfavourable scenarios. Our purpose is to use data from the Indian Premier League cricket tournament to predict match outcomes based on events occurring in the first inning of a match.
